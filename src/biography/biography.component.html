	<h5>Get to know me a little better</h5>
  <hr>
  <p>Hello, my name is Johnathan Ibarra. I am 18 years old born in Waco, Texas and the youngest of three brothers. I am a Software Development and Testing student at Seattle Central College through the Year Up program where I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while still developing my professional and technical skills. I am a fast learner and I am passionate about technology and anything that has to do with Software Development. I am currently looking for an internship or a job opening so that I can showcase and develop my skills, and experience as much as I can in the tech field. I value family and friends and enjoy any type of physical activity that can get me excited and competitive. As you can see from the picture below I have been playing competitive soccer for many years even being able to become a varsity soccer player my freshmen year in highschool.</p>
